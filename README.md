# Tweet Classification
A comparative analysis between machine learning classification methods in
the field of computational social science. This project was completed during
the 2020 election season for the data science course at the University of
Notre Dame.

## Organization
* **code**: Holds python scripts and notebooks to build models and output results. Includes the following nine different machine learning models: ID3 trees, CART Trees, Random Forest Trees, KNN, MLP, SVM, Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Networks, and (Distil)BERT.
* **data**: Data objects for training and testing, including pickle objects.
* **models**: Final models outputted for scripts.
* **\*.pk**: training and test lemmas and vectorizers.
